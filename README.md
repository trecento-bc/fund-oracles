# TrecentoServicesProject

This project contains the services which will be used as middleware for the trecento Platform.

The project is implemented in nodejs using the express framework, and will host all the needed backend services for the platform.

The Services use the web3 JS libray to commuicate with smart contracts.

This project doesn't use truffle.

## Details

### Data
the services uses mock data which is not persisted.
The data will be lost bewteen the restarts of the services.

A database (for example mongoDb) can be added later to persist the data.


Example:
```
const investors = [  {id: 1, firstName: 'Jane', lastName:'Doe'}];
const funds = [  { token: 'TRCOF', name: 'openfund'}];
const subscriptions = [  { id:1, investorId: 1, token: 'TRCOF', quantity:2, subScriptionDate:'2018-03-28T15:09:16Z' }];
```

>The structure of the data when finalized will be stored in the models folder.

### Server.js
A test restful http-server to allow calling the services from the browser to display subscriptions or added investors ( GET requests).

* Example to Get existing subscriptions 
```
http://localhost:8000/api/subscriptions

```

POST requests can be send using "Postman" tool.

* Example to POST new subscriptions

The mock data used in the services is declared in the Server.js file.
